# Housing Guide for Erasmus Students in Salerno

## ESN Housing Support Service
ESN Salerno volunteers provide comprehensive assistance to help international students find suitable accommodation upon arrival in the city. Students should regularly check ESN communication groups for housing appointment notices and availability updates. The volunteer team has extensive experience with the local rental market and can guide students through the entire housing search process.

## Recommended Residential Areas
The most suitable areas for Erasmus students are Carmine, Torrione, and the Irno district, which offer affordable housing options with high concentrations of international students. These neighborhoods provide good access to both the city center and university campuses. The city center offers convenient location but can be more expensive than other areas.

## Areas to Avoid
Students should avoid seeking accommodation near the Fisciano campus due to poor night transportation connections to Salerno city center, where most ESN activities and social events take place. Living near campus may isolate students from the international community and limit participation in evening events.

## Landlord Communication and Requirements
Local landlords typically have limited English or Spanish language skills, making communication challenging without assistance. They require in-person meetings for all rental arrangements and do not conduct remote rentals or virtual viewings. Most landlords prefer rental contracts ranging from 6 to 12 months duration.

## Online Housing Search Platforms
Students can search for accommodation using several Italian real estate websites including idealista.it, casa.it, soloaffitti.it, immobiliare.it, and subito.it. Facebook groups dedicated to housing in Salerno also provide rental opportunities and are frequently used by both students and landlords.

## Housing Costs and Budget Planning
Room rental prices in Salerno typically range from €350 to €650 per month, excluding agent commissions and additional fees. Students should budget for potential security deposits, utility costs, and any administrative fees required by landlords or rental agencies.

## Tax Code Requirements
The Italian tax code (Codice Fiscale) is mandatory for signing rental contracts and completing visa procedures. Students can obtain their tax code at the Agenzia delle Entrate office in Salerno. Provisional tax codes are available for immediate needs while waiting for the permanent version.

How to Get a Tax Code (Codice Fiscale)
To obtain your Italian tax code (codice fiscale), which is required for opening a bank account, signing rental contracts, and other essential services, book an appointment online at https://prenotazioneweb.agenziaentrate.gov.it/PrenotazioneWeb/prenotazione.action. To reach the Agenzia delle Entrate office, take Busitalia bus number 5 from either LUNGOMARE TRIESTE or CONCORDIA bus stops and ride until the UFFICI FINANZIARI AG.ENTRATE stop, which is directly at the tax office. Bring your passport, proof of residence, and student enrollment certificate to your appointment.
## Essential Housing Tips
Focus your housing search primarily on Carmine and Irno areas, with Torrione and city center as secondary options. Always avoid Fisciano due to transportation limitations. Utilize ESN volunteers for landlord meetings and negotiations, as their local knowledge and language skills are invaluable for securing appropriate accommodation.
